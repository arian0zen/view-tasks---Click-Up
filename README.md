# What is used and how is it made ?

- well, first of all it is completely based on clickUp official API and every end points and every fetch request goes directly there
- secondly, I used pure vanilla javascript to code every functionality to run the extension on the browser side, chrome extension is unable to run on a server side (on node js)
- Though, I could have used different webPacks to compile a node js code into vanilla js to run in browser but i chose not to.
